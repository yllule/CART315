## Tiny Game ~ 23/01/25 

[Project for class today](Projects/chrysalis.html)

After trying out the Bitsy games that were linked in the class website, I was impressed by the tool so I wanted to give it a try for this week’s game. I came up with two core mechanics I thought would be interesting to explore.

1- Telling a story through simple repetitive motions of the avatar, sort of like [this game](https://npckc.itch.io/you-are-dough) where you simply move the dough along as it gets turned into bread and get little bits of dialogue that progress the game. I thought of telling a story by having players control the movements of the sun and moon and thus controlling the flow of time. I was also inspired by the game Faith and a personal experience of looping nightmares, and so I thought of maybe making a small pixel horror game with an unending nightmare loop. I didn’t go through with this idea in the end because of the two ideas I had, this seemed the hardest to pull off with Bitsy (especially visually as I imagined it in a similar style to that of Faith’s).

2- Exploring your environment and surroundings and making sense of it. Each room of the game is like a puzzle piece where you must explore all the rooms to make sense of where you are and figure out the shape of the world. I imagined playing the game in the perspective of an insect so that it could be on smaller, more recognizable (to us at least) objects like flowers, leafs, etc.

Like I mentioned before, I went with the second idea for this prototype because it seemed more achievable. I decided on having players control an anxious, shut-in caterpillar as it explores the big world after being forced out of its home (a leaf) after eating it all. Players explore each room of every level (which are separated by different color palettes) to make sense of the environment they’re in. Pieces of caterpillar food are scattered along the rooms to to progress the dialogue/story, but also to guide the player towards certain directions. Once they reach the last room, they are asked what it is they’ve been exploring thus far. Once they make the right decision, they move onto the next level.

I made this in a few hours, but if I had more time for it, I would have improved the visuals and the puzzles (as in, make more rooms for each level and more complex levels). Originally, I thought it would be visually interesting if the smaller tiles of the game formed a bigger visual together, not just for the big “puzzle” pieces of the environment, but for background elements as well. As seen in my sketches, for example in the flower level, I wanted to have other flowers visible in the background. So if I were to improve on this later, I would add more interesting visuals. I maybe would have played around more with Bitsy’s sound tools to make a little song. While I enjoyed using this tool to make my tiny game, it was also frustrating because it would visually bug often and I’d have to refresh my page a lot, so I didn’t feel like making anything too long and complicated (which I guess is fine cause the point was to make a tiny game/prototype).

After doing the class playtest, most people seemed to enjoy the theme and found the game cute and enjoyed the concept of figuring out what your environment is. Like I expected, because there is only one tile for each exit in Bitsy, it led to confusion on which specific tile in the map leads to the next room.
